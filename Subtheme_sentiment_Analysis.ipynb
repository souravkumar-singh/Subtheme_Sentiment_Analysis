I entered my registration and was shown the tyres that were supposedly suitable for my car. I was looking for the same Bridgestone S001 run flat tyres. The S001 tyres appeared at the top of the search results and seemed a good price. I ordered them. Instantly I got an email from [REDACTED] saying they think I have ordered the wrong tyres and they ones I ordered were non run flats and my car would have run flats. Looking at the website again the correct tyres were 4 pages down in the search results and a total of £65 more expensive. Clearly the system knew at the time of checkout that I had potentially the wrong tyres as I got an automated email from them only once I had placed an order!! Trapped why not ask at the time of checkout!!! Had to pay the extra money which then took the total price to more than other quotes I had received.Then onto the fitting. The garage is only a few mins from my house. Booked for 8am on a Saturday. Arrived 7:50am. It then took 1 hour 45 mins to fit 2 tyres. Not impressed. Then when I drove away after that long wait my car warned me that the pressure in the drivers rear tyre was too low. It had about 10 psi less than the rest! So either the garage did not put enough in or the tyre was leaking air. Went back to the garage to get it checked out. No leak just not enough air put in (very dangerous). Drove away a second time to see that this time the same tyre still did not have enough air in it to match the rest of the tyres. I ended up going to a petrol garage and fixing the issue myself with the air pump. Small point also was that my alloys and tyres were absolutely covered in the white tyre lub. You expect some but the alloy was smothered in it. So had to take the car to the cleaners also.So in summary questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience.',\n",

However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy\\'s, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy\\'s customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy\\'s fitted my tyres (although I\\'m very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy\\'s had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy\\'s about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated \"but I changed the valve cores though\".I don\\'t believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn\\'t know, is that I\\'m a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn\\'t notice McConechy\\'s had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn\\'t change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that\\'s why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don\\'t believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn\\'t it ? NO, it certainly doesn\\'t !I was also supposed to have a free wheel alignment check done, the McConechy\\'s fitter never made any mention of this. I had already decided not to go ahead with the alignment check anyway.Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun. There is no way the wheel nuts seen a torque wrench. The McConechy\\'s tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter. Avoid them, you are not a McConechy\\'s customer, you are an annoyance to them, you are getting in their way. Not at all happy with any of this.Steven Dryden.',\n",
